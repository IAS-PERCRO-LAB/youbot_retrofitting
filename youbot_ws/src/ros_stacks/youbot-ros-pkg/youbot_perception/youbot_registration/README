1. What is it?
==============

	-- The youbot_registration package contains a method to compute an unknown 
	   camera frame (extrinsic camera parameters) relative to the KUKA youBot
	   in particular for the Kinect 3D camera. This package will use a marker placed 
	   on the gripper at the KUKA youBot manipulator and assumes the pattern will 
	   be visible by the camera.

2. Installation
===============

	To install the package invoke: 
	
		$rosmake youbot_registration

	This package assumes OpenCV and PCL packages to be installed.
	
3. Usage
========

	3-a. Quick Start
	================
	
	-- Glue the pattern on the youBot manipulator at the center of the finger tip
	   of the left finger (gripper_finger_link_l).

	-- Start youbot driver, joint_sate publisher, and the registration method.
	
		$ roslaunch youbot_oodl youbot_oodl_driver.launch
		$ roslaunch youbot_oodl youbot_joint_state_publisher.launch
		$ roslaunch youbot_registration kinect_registration.launch 
		
	-- Print frame between robot and camera and save results in a launch file for 
	   a static transform publisher.
	   
		$ rosrun tf tf_echo /base_footprint /openni_camera	


	3-b. Preparation of Marker pattern
	==================================	

	-- Print out the pattern. It is located in data/circlesgrid.png. Cut it along
	   the black line and put some double-faced tape on its back.
	   The exact size of the pattern is not so important as long as all circles 
	   will be visible later.
	
	-- Turn of the arm and manually move it to its home position. Then glue the
	   pattern seen from back to front of the youBot on the left gripper finger
	   in such a way that the pattern faces to the front. It is important that 
	   the finger tip is in coincidence with the circle center in the middle of
	   the pattern (cf. Illustration below).
	   Internally this position is represented by the frame /pattern_circle_center
	   Feel free to put the marker to another location but then you need to
	   precisely update that very frame. It can be set up in the kinect_registration.launch
	   file. 


		Center the marker at the X:
			         
                       --X-- -----	   
                       |   | |   |		
                       |   | |   |
                       |   | |   |		          
                     __|   | |   |__
                    |o o o | | o o o|
                 -----------------------
                |                       |
               |         Gripper         |                                                              			     	



	3-c. Running the registration software
	======================================
	
	-- Turn on the youBot and start the driver as usual.
		$ roslaunch youbot_oodl youbot_oodl_driver.launch
		$ roslaunch youbot_oodl youbot_joint_state_publisher.launch
		
	-- Start the registration procedure		
		$ roslaunch youbot_registration kinect_registration.launch
	
	   The procedure will move the arm along a list of predifined configurations
	   while it captures the perceived points as well as the reference point  
	   defined in the internal model. Finally the registration estimates a transform
	   between these two point sets.
	   
	-- During the procedure some points might not be visible, depending on the camera setup,
	   however these point will be ignored. The warning "FindCircles failed" will be printed.
	   The registration will still work as long as at least 3 points in total will be visible. 
	   
	-- The procedure typically stops with the message "Registration Succeed". The reuslting TF frame 
	   from will be published from now on.


	3-d. Storing the result
	========================
	
	-- You can get the values of the registered camera fram via invoking	

		$ rosrun tf tf_echo /base_footprint /openni_camera
		
	   The result will look something like: 	
		
		At time 1339671252.201
		- Translation: [-0.137, 0.124, 0.573]
		- Rotation: in Quaternion [0.069, 0.185, -0.290, 0.936]
		            in RPY [0.023, 0.397, -0.596]
		            
	-- If you want to store the result you could craete a new launch file that
	   will start an appropriate static_transform_publisher. Just copy over the
	   translation and rotation values.		            
		                        
		<launch>
			<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="youbot_kinect_static_registration" args="-0.137 0.124 0.573 0.069 0.185 -0.290 0.936 /base_footprint /openni_camera 500" />
		</launch>
